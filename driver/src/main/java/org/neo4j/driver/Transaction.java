 * Logical container for an atomic unit of work.

 * which ensures that <code>COMMIT</code> or <code>ROLLBACK</code>
 * occurs correctly on close. Note that <code>ROLLBACK</code> is the
 * default action unless {@link #success()} is called before closing.

 *     tx.run("CREATE (a:Person {name: {x}})", parameters("x", "Alice"));
 *     tx.success();
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Blocking calls are: {@link #success()}, {@link #failure()}, {@link #close()}
 * and various overloads of {@link #run(Statement)}.
