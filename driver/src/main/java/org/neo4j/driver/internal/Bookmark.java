/**
 * Causal chaining is carried out by passing bookmarks between transactions.
 *
 * When starting a session with initial bookmarks, the first transaction will be ensured to run at least after
 * the database is as up-to-date as the latest transaction referenced by the supplied bookmarks.
 *
 * Within a session, bookmark propagation is carried out automatically.
 * Thus all transactions in a session including explicit and implicit transactions are ensured to be carried out one after another.
 *
 * To opt out of this mechanism for unrelated units of work, applications can use multiple sessions.
